#mob

Mob is a multi user application platform. To showcase it's
capabilities the example projects include a simple chat application 
and a 3D multi user duck pond 'game'. 

# install

Calling `npm install` from the command-line should do the trick.

# running the examples

Call `node examples/exampleServer` from the command-line and then visit
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). From there you can go to 1
of the example pages. Visit the same URL from another client (or browser)
and tada, you're muli-usering!

will follow as soon as possible.
